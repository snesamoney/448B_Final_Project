          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            It is estimated that nearly 1 million people in the United States are living with Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
            (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke).
          </p>
          <p>
            While Parkinson’s Disease is most often recognized by its visible motor symptoms and slowness of movement,
            one of its earliest and most subtle indicators is often heard rather than seen. The human voice is a complex
            instrument produced by the precise coordination of airflow and muscle control. For patients with PD, the
            neurological degradation that affects limb movement also impacts the larynx and vocal folds, leading to a
            condition known as dysphonia. This typically manifests as a softer, breathy, or monotonic voice, often
            appearing years before an actual diagnosis of PD. This article explores the potential of using these subtle
            acoustic changes as digital biomarkers. By analyzing a dataset of voice recordings from both healthy
            individuals and diagnosed patients, we look at distinct human voice biomarkers such as pitch instability
            (jitter), loudness variation (shimmer), and many other biomarkers to see the effectiveness of these voice
            biomarkers to detect the PD.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand the data, we will first look at the biology behind PD. Vocal cords are delicate folds of tissue
            that vibrate thousands of times per second to produce sound. In a healthy voice, this vibration is periodic
            and stable. However, PD causes patients to have a lack of fine motor control in their laryngeal muscles. This
            instability leaves a mathematical footprint in the voice signal, presenting itself as useful acoustic
            biomarkers to analyze. The dataset used in this article consists of various acoustic measurements categorized
            into groups such as Jitter (frequency variation), Shimmer (amplitude variation), and certain non-linear
            measurements. For example, a healthy voice holds a steady pitch, while a PD voice may have higher jitter from
            fluctuating microscopically from cycle to cycle.

          <h2>How Parkinson’s Disrupts Vocal Stability and Volume</h2>
          <p>
            Parkinson’s disease negatively impacts the delicate muscles of the larynx, causing vocal instability. In
            research, this is referred to as <strong>jitter</strong>, the cycle-to-cycle variation in the pitch
            (fundamental frequency) of a person's voice, caused by irregularities in vocal fold vibration. This is largely
            driven by the rigidity, stiffness, and tremor of the laryngeal muscles in the presence of Parkinson's disease,
            causing more irregular and erratic oscillations in pitch. Consequently, people with Parkinson's often exhibit
            higher jitter, which can result in a rough or harsh vocal quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, these disrupted muscles also impact the control an individual has over the volume of their voice.
            In research, this is referred to as <strong>shimmer</strong>, the cycle-to-cycle fluctuations in the amplitude
            of the voice. Just as jitter is often used as a metric to assess the progression of PD, shimmer can be used in
            the same way. PD patients tend to exhibit higher-than-normal shimmer because the disease disrupts the
            physiological mechanisms that control voice volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            The box plot visualization below shows how these moment-to-moment variations compare between PD patients and
            healthy controls. Even though individual fluctuations seem small, their cumulative pattern can reveal
            meaningful differences. Every colored dot represents one person’s voice. The number on the x-axis is the
            recording index (1st recording, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The y-axis can display either jitter or shimmer and can be
            changed using the provided drop-down menu.
          </p>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Higher jitter means a more unstable, shaky, or breathy voice.</li>
            <li>Higher shimmer means greater fluctuation in the volume of the individual’s voice.</li>
            <li>Healthy speakers (blue) tend to have low, steady jitter/shimmer values.</li>
            <li>Subjects with Parkinson’s disease (red) typically show higher jitter/shimmer and more fluctuation between recordings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Use the slider to reveal how jitter changes across recordings and to compare how stable each subject’s voice
            remains over time.

          <h2>Finding Other Interesting Biomarkers via Scatterplots</h2>
          <p>
            While a single time series illustration helps highlight how irregularities appear and change over time,
            Parkinson’s cannot be diagnosed from a couple of biomarkers alone. We instead look for patterns that repeat
            across many different biomarkers. To better understand these diverse signals, we shift from a temporal view to
            a multivariate perspective. One way to discover these patterns is through scatterplots of two features on each
            of the X-axis and Y-axis.
          </p>

          <h3>For Example...</h3>
          <p>
            The plot below initially shows a scatterplot of PPE (Pitch Period Entropy) and Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)
            across both healthy subjects and patients with PD.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both PPE and HNR measures capture complementary dimensions of vocal degradation. PPE rises when pitch becomes
            unstable and irregular, while HNR falls as the voice loses its harmonic structure and becomes noisier. When
            plotted together, these opposing effects create a clear separation: Healthy voices cluster tightly in the
            low-PPE, high-HNR region and patients with PD have voices shifting toward higher PPE and lower HNR.
          </p>
          <p>
            PPE and HNR are just one example of a particularly strong pairing, but not the only features worth exploring.
            By experimenting with other combinations of features, you may uncover pairings that produce even sharper
            boundaries or reveal more nuanced patterns between healthy subjects and those with PD. Feel free to interact
            and try out various feature pairs across the Multi-Chart comparison visualization and see if any unique pairs
            stand out!
          </p>

              <li><strong>Select X and Y axes:</strong> Use the dropdown menus to choose which variables to plot. A brief description of the selected variable appears in the gray information box.</li>

              <li><strong>Toggle regression lines:</strong> Enable linear regression lines for each group. Hovering over a line displays its R² value (coefficient of determination) via a tooltip and highlights only the points belonging to that group. R² values below 0.15 are marked red, whereas values 1.5 or higher are marked green.</li>
              <li><strong>Toggle Y-min &amp; Y-max per group:</strong> Display horizontal lines marking each group’s minimum and maximum Y-axis values. Hovering reveals the max or min value and highlights only that group’s points.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            After looking across many different feature pairings, a few clear patterns begin to stand out. Some
            combinations show only mild separation, while others reveal sharper distinctions between the healthy and PD
            clusters. Rather than treating this exploration as a final answer, it acts as a compass that points us toward
            which biomarkers are worth deeper investigation. The multi-chart comparison gives us a broad map of the
            feature landscape. The next step is to zoom in on individual biomarkers to understand why certain features
            perform better and how they behave on their own.

          <h2>Exploring Individual Vocal Biomarkers</h2>
          <p>
            Having surveyed the broader feature space, we now turn our attention to the biomarkers themselves. Instead of
            looking at features two at a time, this section isolates each one to examine its distribution and overall
            diagnostic value. By focusing on individual features, we can see which vocal biomarkers consistently differ
            between healthy and Parkinson’s speakers. This microscopic view can help explain why certain combinations
            stand out in the earlier scatterplots.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interactive visualization below allows you to explore the diagnostic power of these different vocal
            features. In the lower distribution plot, each dot represents a person. The goal of a diagnostic test is to
            separate these two groups as best as possible. By dragging the threshold slider, the vertical black line is
            adjusted, which acts as the decision boundary when evaluating the effectiveness of a vocal feature. A highly
            effective feature such as PPE or RPDE, a non-linear feature, will show a distinct separation between the green
            and red clusters, allowing the threshold line to split them with minimal error.
          </p>
          <p>
            An effective way to measure the effectiveness of the classification is to plot a Receiver Operating
            Characteristic (ROC) Curve. It visualizes the trade-off between catching the disease and avoiding false
            positives. As you drag the slider to change the threshold decision line, the black marker on the ROC curve
            moves along the blue curve. Moving the threshold to catch more patients increases the True Positive Rate but
            comes at the cost of incorrectly diagnosing more healthy people to be sick, which increases the False Positive
            Rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The measure of a feature's success is the ROC's AUC (Area Under the Curve), displayed on the bottom right. An
            AUC of 0.5 suggests the feature is no better than a coin flip, while an AUC of 1.0 represents a perfect test.
            By exploring different features in the dropdown menu, you can see that while basic pitch measurements often
            struggle to distinguish the groups, other non-linear measurements like PPE (Pitch Period Entropy) have some of
            the strongest predictive power for PD, which is aligned with the feature-pair classification in the
            visualization above as well.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In the end, the patterns across these visualizations reveal a subtle but consistent story: Parkinson’s disease
            alters vocal behavior in ways that become visible when we examine the right biomarkers. Features like PPE,
            HNR, and jitter-based metrics repeatedly emerge as strong indicators, providing clearer separation between
            healthy and PD patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            By experimenting with new feature combinations, more patterns or subtle subclusters within the PD and healthy
            groups are still left to be discovered. The work here illustrates how the “silent cues” of the human voice can
            become powerful digital biomarkers for earlier and more precise detection of Parkinson’s disease.
